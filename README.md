Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems.
Its impotance to technology industry is that it enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Structured Programming (1960s-1970s) – Introduced by Edsger Dijkstra, structured programming improved code clarity and maintainability by using loops, conditionals, and modular design.

Object-Oriented Programming (1980s-1990s) – Languages like C++ and Java popularized OOP, organizing code into reusable objects with encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Agile Methodology (2000s-Present) – The Agile Manifesto (2001) promoted iterative development, continuous feedback, and adaptability, leading to widespread use of frameworks like Scrum and Kanban.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement- This is a stage where the devoper gathers and documents on the project.
design- creating a high level and design of the software architecture and user interface
Implementation- This is the actual coding and building of the software
Testing- The software undergoes testing to ensure it meets the quality standards
Deployment- The software at this point is released to the actual end users
Maintenace- it includes support and regular updates after deployment
  

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Agile is an iterative approach to software development, emphasizing flexibility and collaboration among cross-functional teams. It focuses on delivering small, incremental releases, adapting to changes throughout the development process while Waterfall is a linear and sequential approach, where each phase must be completed before moving to the next. Changes are difficult to incorporate once a phase is completed.
Agile promotes adaptability and customer feedback, while Waterfall provides a structured plan but may struggle with accommodating changes late in the development cycle.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs is a software that proide comprehensive tools for writing, debuggingg and testing code eg visual studio.
VCS is a software tool for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members eg GIT

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Changing requirements of what the software needs should be solved.
2. Tight deadlines
3. Technical debts

Overcoming this challenges is achieved through regular communications, priotizing task and regular reassment of goalls and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing- it is indivually testing components of the software
intergration testing- tssting interaction btwn different modules
system- it is testing the whole system as large
Acceptance testing- Testing on how end users think of the system and if it meets their needs

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: History of Dogs and mankind
improved prompt: Dogs are termed as men best friend. Explain how this phrase came to existence.
